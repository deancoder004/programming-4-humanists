Lady of the Ferry Inn

Who am I? I am a lady of the faithful to the ways
of the Ferry Inn.
I run a tavern and cheat no one.
The moon in its robes of snow clouds 
welcomes you
and your silver coins.

Beofre the men who drink here, I offer
a perfect world.
I want nothing more.
I walk among men, faultlessly,
sing intimate songs
and pour the mead.
